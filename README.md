# Mapping NZ roads in Python

Python implementation of [Aaron Schiff's work in R](https://github.com/aaronschiff/nz-simple-road-maps) within a Jupyter notebook.

## Project overview
This is an example of how to make a map of New Zealand roads in Python. The road dataset can be downloaded from: [LINZ](https://data.linz.govt.nz/layer/50329-nz-road-centrelines-topo-150k/). This workbook has two outputs:
- A PNG (or PDF) file containing a map of all NZ roads
- A PNG (or PDF) file containing six small maps showing roads with different characteristics (sealed, metalled, state highways, etc)

## Accreditations
- [LINZ](https://data.linz.govt.nz/) - dataset
- [Aaron Schiff](https://github.com/aaronschiff) - initial implementation in R
